It is within this context that Lighthouse Christian College indeed shines a light in how to redress  these concerns.    The capacity of a private school to not only go against the grain of popular culture, but be a  thriving example of excellence and best practice, is in no small part due to the sacriﬁces,  toil and eﬀort of so many people passionate about Christian education. For this reason  alone, it is timely that the school take stock and record its remarkable history of 30 years.  The servant leadership across the leadership team is exemplary as you read the following  pages and see a school that is highly professional, unafraid to be self-reﬂective, and open  to critique. Despite the relatively short life of the school, Lighthouse has been able to impact  in quite unique ways in local, national and global contexts. Indeed, they have risen to their  Christian mandate to boldly step into spaces with love and grace where justice and mercy  are needed.    Their journey, reﬂected in this history, will provide a rich resource for anyone wanting to  garner how to grow a Christian school community, which spawns graduates who are  equipped to step up and be the person God has called them to be in this rapidly changing  world. I congratulate Ps Richard, Mrs Avril Howard and the entire team on a truly remarkable  journey of faith and obedience, and trust that Lighthouse Christian College will continue to  grow its inﬂuence and impact - for God will be gloriﬁed by these fruits of the Spirit.

Methodology:                 • This history presented as an e-book and special edition hard copy is not an in-depth investigative study,                    but rather a broad coverage of the history of Lighthouse Christian College which I believe is one way of                    bringing its incredible story of faith, hope and fulfilment of a vision to a vast number of people.                 • It has been my greatest joy to devote my time, despite working within immense time constraints, to                    reveal the miraculous power of God, His mercy and grace and above all His Masterly Hand at work at                    Lighthouse Christian College.                 • It should be noted that, from the point of view of the educational historian, the quality of record-keeping                    used by the school has not been entirely satisfactory due to limited personnel and financial resources.                 • Therefore oral history accounts have been extensively used to bridge the gaps.               • The history is presented using a conventional approach of chronological order; however, this is done                      within a modern format of multimedia.","Index    Chapter 1 – From Vision to Reality        7    Chapter 2 – Symbols of the College        11    Chapter 3 – Pioneering Years (1990-1995)  14    Chapter 4 – Expansion and Progress (1996-2001) 19    Chapter 5 – Innovation (2002-2007)        26    Chapter 6 – Fan Into Flame (2008-2012)    30    Chapter 7 – Good to Great (2013)          38    Chapter 8 – The Golden Years (2014-2019)  45","Chapter One    From Vision to Reality    Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptising  them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and of  the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things  whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am  with you always, even unto the end of the world.  Amen (Matthew 29:19-20)    Over thirty years ago, the Lighthouse Christian  Church under the leadership of Pastor Richard  Warner and his wife Pauline, was motivated towards  starting a Christian school, originally to be named as,  ‘Springvale Christian College’ as a Kindergarten to  VCE Year 12 college (K-12) on Springvale Road,  Keysborough.    “It all began in my heart…” says Pastor Richard             Pastors Richard and Pauline Warner and family  Warner as he reflects on how Lighthouse Christian  College came into existence. After the birth of his  own two children, Karen and Richard, in the 1970s,  Pastor Warner began to seriously consider not just  their education future, but their God-given destiny.  Whilst in Queensland, Townsville, he was inspired by  the establishment of an “adventurous” school called  Calvary Temple Christian College headed by the  Senior Pastor, David Cartledge and the passion and  enthusiasm of the local parents as they worked  towards building what was the first Assemblies of  God Christian school in Australia. Eventually Pastor  Warner was to leave Townsville to become an  itinerant minister but this did not stop his journey  into Christian education. During this time he was  exposed to the benefits of the Accelerated Christian  Education program and while his attempts to start a  Christian school in Devonport, Tasmania were not to  come to fruition, the dream remained alive    In moving to Springvale South the possibilities of the  dream becoming a reality were further realised as  Pastor Warner, driven by the desire to fulfil God’s  plans and purposes, began the search for a block of  land (about 7-10 acres) which would accommodate  the buildings necessary for a church and school. His  vision while at Springvale, was to have a centre  which would cater for the whole of life, “from the  cradle to the grave.” God’s providence can be seen  in the eventual acquisition of this property as Pastor  Warner describes it below:                                                             7","“Nevertheless we began to search the surrounding            A year later, after much promotion, planning and  areas and out of many options we found a more               faith, Lighthouse Christian College (1989) was  suitable block of land at lots 4 and 5 Springvale Road      birthed.  Keysborough (which is the present block of land)  which we occupy. At that particular time (1987) the  2 adjacent 5 acre blocks were sold to the Catholic  Croatian Centre opposite, but they were having  difficulties raising the finance towards their future  soccer fields and recreations plans. The project fell  through for them and we immediately came into the  arena offering $170,000 dollars for the two blocks of  land (a total of 10 ½ acres). Our offer was accepted  and an exciting journey began.” (Richard Warner,  2008)    Initially there was little confidence and even  opposition shown by the church congregation to  commence a Christian school, especially after the  unsuccessful attempts by others to start Christian  schools in Victoria, but after three years of sowing  the vision to the congregation, coupled with a fast  growing church, “it was decided at an AGM meeting  to launch proceedings to start a Christian school”  (Les Clark, 2008) and to sell the property in  Springvale South and move to Keysborough.    With this hurdle being overcome the next challenge  was a financial one, to not only purchase the 10 ½  acre block of land but to also commence a building  project. Approximately $200,000 was available in  equity from the buildings in Springvale but this was  significantly insufficient for the project that lay  ahead. By an amazing miracle, $186,000 was  pledged by the church congregation towards the  project thereby enabling the planning of the new  project to commence.    The objective of the first building plan was to build a     Mr & Mrs Les Clark  multipurpose building that would be suitable both  for church and school use. Pastor Richard, together  with his Assistant Pastor, Uwe Kruithoff, then  drafted a design for the present church building  measuring 40 x 60 metres. Having one million dollars  available for the building project, they were  horrified by the quotes they received from several  builders of between 1.5 and 2 million dollars for the  building. The search then began for a builder who  would construct the building for one million dollars.  God’s provision at this time was Alan Fraser, who  agreed to take on the project at the price the church  could afford. In 1988 the church moved into their  new building with “great fan fair and celebration.”                                                             8","The First Year (1989)                                         operations.

Subsequently a school Bible  verse (Isaiah 54:13) and song were developed.  Other symbols included the school logo and  carefully selected school colours representing the  attributes of God. By 1990 a college Handbook had  been developed by Pastor Les Clark and Mr Philip  Andrew which provided parents with the essential  information about the school’s operations for  example fees and uniforms. By 2008 a school hymn  was voted in by staff and students and added to the  set of school symbols and themes.  SCHOOL NAME  Lighthouse Christian College  The name LIGHTHOUSE evolved from 1981 to 1989  through the prayer life of the church. Promoted by  the Holy Spirit the church found themselves being  led to pray ‘Lord, make us a lighthouse to South East  Melbourne’ (P. Warner, 2008), and so it became a  natural progression for the church to eventually  refer to themselves as Lighthouse Christian Centre,  or Lighthouse Christian Community Centre. In  designing the new buildings the large circular  window on the western front of the church “cried  out for an emblem” and so for the first 20 years as a  Lighthouse was painted on it. When the school was  registered Pastor Les Clark took the initiative and  named it Lighthouse Christian College as it would  serve as a reminder of the link between the church  and the school and the call to be a lighthouse to the  world around and the nations.

Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee                     Text: Henry Van Dyke              Music: Ludwig Van Beethoven              Arrangement: Edward Hodges                      Tune: HYMN TO JOY      1. Joyful, joyful, we adore thee,             God of glory, Lord of love;           hearts unfold like flowers before thee,           opening to the sun above.           Melt the clouds of sin and sadness;           drive the dark of doubt away.           Giver of immortal gladness,           fill us with the light of day!      2. All thy works with joy surround thee,           earth and heaven reflect thy rays,           starts and angels sing around thee,           center of unbroken praise.           Field and forest, vale and mountain,           flowery meadow, flashing sea,           chanting bird and flowing fountain,           call us to rejoice in thee      3. Thou art giving and forgiving,           ever blessing, ever blest,           well-spring of the joy of living,           ocean depth of happy rest!           Thou our Father, Christ our brother           all who live in love are thine;           teach us how to love each other,           lift us to the joy divine.      4. Mortals, join the mighty chorus,           which the morning stars began;           love divine is reigning o’er us,           binding all within its span.           Ever singing, march we onward,           victors in the midst of strife;           joyful music leads us sunward,           in the triumph song of life.  http://www.hymnsite.com/lyrics/umh089.sht                                                                           13","Chapter Three                                             tables for activities in the hall.

Eventually Mrs Sandra Vincent (now  Barnett) and Miss Georgi Gradev (now Barnett)  were added to this team, and Mrs Barnett remained  as school Bursar up until 2003. Mrs Georgi Barnett  was also involved in the student life of the college  and attended ski trips and the Duke of Edinburgh  excursions. Miss Jo Achkar took over the role of                                                            18","Chapter Four                                                 to build their own on-site sewerage treatment plant; as                                                               well as receiving government funding to build a new  Expansion and Progress (1996 – 2001)                         toilet block instead of the students having to use the                                                               church toilets all the time.

Mr Jacob Mathews who served as the deputy  principal under Pastor Newton before eventually  taking over as Principal of the college by late1996.    In his ﬁrst year of being Principal, in addition to all  his educational responsibilities including the  development of a comprehensive college handbook,  Pastor Newton was faced with an unusually big  challenge regarding property development, which  he describes below:   ‘To my surprise, having just arrived from a small  town in NSW without sewerage, I discovered there  was no sewerage connection to Lighthouse. In fact,  the school and church were more than a kilometre  in each direction from the nearest sewer main. The  buildings depended on a septic system that was  clearly inadequate for a growing school population.  In 1995, we had a very wet year and the whole  problem “spilled over”. Raw sewerage ﬂowed down  the driveway one day! Surely we would have to close  on health grounds! Somehow we survived. LCC was  a walking miracle in more than one way for a few  years.                                                                 By term four of 1996 Mr J.
